## Getting Started

### First Time Setup

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed)
   - Download from https://www.python.org/
   - Version 3.9 or higher required
   - Check: `python --version`

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd Circuit_Guard_New
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Wait 5-10 minutes for installation to complete.

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   python -c "import torch, cv2, streamlit; print('Ready!')"
   ```
   
   Should print "Ready!" without errors.

### Launch the Application

**Web Interface**
```bash
cd inference
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser will open automatically at http://localhost:8501

---

## Using the Web Interface

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Open the Application

After running `streamlit run app.py`, you'll see the PCB Defect Detector interface.

#### 2. Configure Settings (Sidebar)

**Model Path:**
- Default: `../training/checkpoints/best_model.pth`
- Only change if you have a custom trained model

**Class Mapping:**
- Default: `../data/splits/class_mapping.json`
- Maps defect IDs to names

**Minimum Defect Area:**
- Slider: 50-500 pixels
- **Lower (50-100)**: Detects smaller defects, may include noise
- **Default (120)**: Balanced detection
- **Higher (200-500)**: Only large defects, cleaner results

**Minimum Confidence:**
- Slider: 0.0-1.0
- **0.5 (default)**: Show moderately confident predictions
- **0.7-0.8**: High confidence only
- **0.9+**: Very strict, most reliable

#### 3. Upload Images

**Template PCB (Left Side):**
- Upload a defect-free reference board
- This is your *Template Sample*
- Must be same PCB design as test board
- Format: JPG, JPEG, or PNG

**Test PCB (Right Side):**
- Upload the board you want to inspect
- Should have similar lighting/angle as template
- Format: JPG, JPEG, or PNG

**Tips:**
- Use clear, well-lit images
- Avoid shadows or glare
- Keep camera angle consistent
- Higher resolution = better detection

#### 4. Run Detection

Click the blue **"Detect Defects"** button.

Progress indicators show:
1. Saving images... (20%)
2. Finding defects... (40%)
3. Loading model... (60%)

## Advanced Usage

### Command Line Detection

For automation or batch processing:

```bash
cd inference
python detect_defects.py
```

Customize parameters:
```python
from detect_defects import detect_defects

aligned, filtered, defects = detect_defects(
    test_path="boards/test_01.jpg",
    template_path="templates/template_A.jpg",
    min_area=150  # Adjust threshold
)

print(f"Found {len(defects)} defects")
```

### Batch Processing

Process multiple boards:

```python
import os
import sys
sys.path.append('inference')
from detect_defects import detect_defects
from classify_defects import classify_defects
import cv2

template = "template.jpg"
test_folder = "test_boards/"
output_folder = "results/"

for test_file in os.listdir(test_folder):
    if test_file.endswith('.jpg'):
        print(f"Processing {test_file}...")
        
        # Detect
        test_path = os.path.join(test_folder, test_file)
        aligned, filtered, defects = detect_defects(test_path, template, min_area=120)
        
        # Classify
        if len(defects) > 0:
            classified = classify_defects(
                aligned, defects, 
                "model.pth", "mapping.json"
            )
            result = draw_classified_defects(aligned, classified, 0.5)
            
            # Save
            output_path = os.path.join(output_folder, f"result_{test_file}")
            cv2.imwrite(output_path, result)
            
        print(f"✓ {test_file}: {len(defects)} defects")
```

### Custom Confidence Thresholds

Different thresholds for different defect types:

```python
classified = classify_defects(aligned, defects, model_path, mapping_path)

# Strict for critical defects
critical_defects = [d for d in classified 
                   if d['class'] in ['Open_circuit', 'Short'] 
                   and d['confidence'] >= 0.8]

# Lenient for cosmetic issues
cosmetic_defects = [d for d in classified 
                   if d['class'] in ['Spur', 'Mouse_bite'] 
                   and d['confidence'] >= 0.6]
```

## Best Practices

### Image Quality

**DO:**
✅ Use consistent lighting
✅ Keep camera angle perpendicular
✅ Use high resolution (at least 600×600)
✅ Clean board before imaging
✅ Use same camera for template and test

**DON'T:**
❌ Mix different lighting conditions
❌ Use blurry or out-of-focus images
❌ Include shadows or reflections
❌ Rotate or skew boards
❌ Use compressed/low-quality images

### Template Selection

**Good Template:**
- 100% defect-free board
- Same PCB design revision
- Clear, high-quality image
- Representative of "golden sample"

**Bad Template:**
- Has any defects (even minor)
- Different PCB revision
- Poor image quality
- Different angle or lighting

### Settings Optimization

**For Small Components:**
- Minimum area: 80-100 pixels
- Confidence: 0.6-0.7

**For General Inspection:**
- Minimum area: 120 pixels (default)
- Confidence: 0.5

**For Large Components Only:**
- Minimum area: 200-300 pixels
- Confidence: 0.5-0.6

**For High Precision:**
- Minimum area: 100 pixels
- Confidence: 0.8-0.9

### Workflow Tips

1. **Start with defaults** - Only adjust if needed
2. **Check false positives** - Raise confidence if too many
3. **Check false negatives** - Lower min_area if missing defects
4. **Save good templates** - Keep library of defect-free boards
5. **Document settings** - Note what works for each board type

**Q: Can I train on my own data?**
A: Yes! See Training Pipeline documentation.

**Q: How much data is needed for training?**
A: Minimum 50-100 examples per defect class. More is better.

**Q: Can I add new defect types?**
A: Yes, retrain model with new classes and update class mapping.

---

### Troubleshooting

**Q: "Model not found" error**
A: Check the model path in settings or train a model first.

**Q: No defects detected**
